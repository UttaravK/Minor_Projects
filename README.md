# Projects

## Project 1: Text Clustering
### Technologies: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Python, Algorithm: DBSCAN

In this individual project, I have implemented DBSCAN clustering algorithm (in-built libraries were not used). Additionally, worked with text data (news records) in document-term sparse matrix format and designed a proximity function for the text data.

## Project 2: Recommendation System for GitHub Repositories
### Technologies: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Django, Collaborative Filtering, React, Node.JS, AWS Elastic Beanstalk

In this group project, we have designed and implemented a recommendation system for the GitHub repositories. This recommendation system consists of Personalized Recommendations which includes recommending relevant repositories and users; and recommending Trending Repositories and Users.


## Project 3: Viasat Hackathon Project
### Technologies: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Django Framework

In this group project, we have analyzed and classified customer’s text requests received on various Viasat’s portal. Classification is based on the priority associated with the issue along with the area of operation (eg. Service, Billing, Account). Additionally, an automatic reply system has been setup for recurring issues. This application will help Customer Relationship Agents in decreasing the response time to the requests and eventually improve customer’s experience.


## Project 4: Multi-Class Audio Classification
### Technologies: Librosa Module, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Algorithms: Random Forest, Neural Networks.

In this group project, we have analyzing and classified the sound clippings of everyday things (fire alarms, cars honking, dogs barking, etc.) using machine learning and data mining techniques. The result of the classification will be used to send notification on the mobile phone of a hearing-impaired person, which will assist him to overcome his disability and perform duties as a normal person will.
